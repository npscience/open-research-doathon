In here can go general ideas / issues from previous events for use in your events!

Ideas:

* Trying to find / reuse an open data set
* Building engaging (and open) visualizations of open research data
* Adding some field-specific examples to Data Carpentry lessons
* Building a software library (Python module/ R package/ Ruby gem etc.) to facilitate access to and processing of open data from specific sources
* Building a set of Wikidata SPARQL queries for a specific field
* Harvesting data from the supplementary files of scholarly publications
* Participating in research-related activities that others are planning for Open Data Day
* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Adding a “research data” section to the [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/)
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with open research data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing data-centric grant proposals
* Make your own data FAIR
* Test out reproducible computational tools such as [Binder](http://mybinder.org/), [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) (see [this list of resources](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/blob/master/reproducible_open_data_resources.md))
* Prototype a tool to leverage the open datasets in eLife or in repositories ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/), etc)
* Prototype a tool to make it easy for researchers to share/discover/consume comprehensive, open and FAIR data
* Devise a mechanism to incentivise deposition, review and reuse of datasets

* How to identify issues to work on
  - Get participants to come up with new ideas and post them before the event
  - Look around for ideas that have been posted elsewhere

* How to match ideas and participants
* How to call for help
* How to communicate between on-site and remote participants
* How to document what has been done and learned
* When to have breaks and whether and how to structure them
