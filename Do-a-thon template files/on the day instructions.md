# How to start a do-a-thon day

This takes about a morning. However, the outcome is a well-fed group of people who're getting to work on projects and feel comfortable with each other.  

## Arrivals

Set about an hour for people to filter in and chat over breakfast. Give people stick on name tags, in fact, give them many! To keep things visible at distance have a tag each for:

* First name
* Contact (email / Twitter)
* Some words to spark conversation (aka metadata)

On Twitter, ask folks joining remotely to say hello in your hashtag!

Try and get folks on the wifi asap, one just one device. To save yourself crashing the internet tell them to stop using their usual syncing tools (dropbox, drive etc). They don't need it, and that's what causes most problems.

## Welcome

Spend as little time as possible talking at the start. Important things to touch on are:

* Context: At the highest level, why is the topic you're working on important?
* What's the possibility: What can happen at the event if people work for it?
* Logistics & house keeping
 * What's the program?
 * Where are the toilets, fire exits, WiFi, food, etc.
 * Ask whether folks don't want to be photographed

 You don't need slides for this, just use your repository.   

 * Give folks a feel for the room: do some quick hand raising e.g:
  * what's your background (researcher, dev, advocate, librarian, student)
  * how many of you are experienced around research data?
  * how many of you have not been to a hack / do-a-thon before?
  * how many of you come from outside of XYZ?
  * how many of you have made open data before?
  * how many of you are dependent on open data?
  * who doesn't know anyone?

## Getting to know each other & the topic

Break people out into groups (anywhere from 5 - 8 works) to get to know one another & the topic. Suggested structure can include:

* Have introductions of people
  * What’s your name / Twitter
  * What have you come here to do?
  * What type of data are you interested in
   * e.g. genomic data, MRI data, word frequency
  * I know a bit about...
  * What would you like to see happen today
* Introductions to the topic
  * Here just allow folks to discuss what's on their mind. Encourage new folks to speak up and ask the silly question.

For these sessions, use a Google doc (or similar) to take notes on introductions & questions. Later, these can be reviewed by everyone to get a deeper idea of who's attending in the room and online. Think about providing in-room references for people to indicate where they are (e.g. number the tables).

Tweet each introduction into your hashtag.

## Take a break!

Let folks take a break, and read the notes others took & think about ideas they'd like to pitch. This is also
We'd suggest that this time can also be used for people to grab lunch.

## Pitching

Keep this really simple, ideally do it over food. Two minutes, no slides, encourage people to use less. This isn't about "winning", it's about encouraging collaboration.

To sign up for a pitch, have people make issues. Ensure someone is on hand to convene a group of people not interested in other ideas!

Remote participants can pitch live on Google hangouts, or, via a recorded video on Youtube.

## Team formation

In a small (30-ish) group, this seems to be easily done with little to no hassle. Folks can just shout out, or, co-ordinate via issues (preferable for remote folks).

## Introducing documentation & help mechanisms

You don't want to cram too much information into your intro. Introducing things slowly helps people keep up and builds habits slowly.

Around 30 minutes to an hour after team formation, start to introduce the idea that participants should document their progress & ask others to help on Github.

### How to document

Have regular document sprints (say, 1-2 min per hour). Keep them fun (e.g. change the soundscape for that documentation period). Try and get people to make or comment on issues, and of course tweet out.

### How to ask for help

Simply post a new issue to Github. The advanced level of this is to connect it with the original issue!

### Making sure folks got it

You'll need to speak to people 1:1 to see if they got this, and why they should do it. This will mean next time they're much more likely to do it!

# Day two...

On day two, you'll lose a few people and it'll be slow to start. That's okay, embrace the quiet to get things done! This is where all your hard work connecting people in day one will pay off.

Continue to encourage documentation and collaboration throughout the day.
