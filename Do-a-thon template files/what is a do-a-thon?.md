# What is a do-a-thon?

It's an event centered around:
* getting things done (including documenting them), and building on what has come before
* low-fi, informal participatory programming
* encouraging remote participation, and diverse in-person participation
* inclusive activities (not just "hacking" on code) encouraged

It's also an event with a soundtrack: [listen.hatnote.com](http://listen.hatnote.com/#en,fa,ar,sa,es,de,ru,jp,zh,ko) (you can configure that).

#Â Why do a do-a-thon?

You're bored of listening to talks and other monologues, and think it's more important to use your time to engage with others and to work together on issues you care about. You want an event format that supports that and is easy to create.
